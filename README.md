# 🧬 Functional Programming Projects

Welcome! 👋  
This repository contains a collection of my projects built using **Functional Programming (FP)** principles with JavaScript.  
Each project demonstrates key FP concepts such as:

- 💡 Immutability  
- 🧼 Pure Functions  
- 🔁 Function Composition (`pipe`, `compose`)  
- ✅ Higher-Order Functions

## 📂 Projects

### 🎬 [CineWise – Movie Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/Mostafa-36/CineWise---Movie-Recommendation-Engine)  
A movie recommendation engine built entirely using functional programming techniques.  
It leverages `pipe`, `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` to create a clean and composable logic flow.

## 📌 Why This Repository?

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate how functional programming can be applied to build **clean**, **testable**, and **maintainable** real-world applications.  
It serves both as a personal portfolio and a learning resource for others interested in FP.
