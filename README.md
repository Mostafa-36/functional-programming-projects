# 🧬 Functional Programming Projects

Welcome 👋!  
This repository contains a collection of my projects built using **Functional Programming (FP)** principles with JavaScript.  
Each project is designed to follow concepts such as:

- 💡 Immutability
- 🧼 Pure Functions
- 🔁 Function Composition (`pipe`, `compose`)
- ✅ Higher-Order Functions

## 📂 Projects

### 🎬 [FP Movie Recommender](https://github.com/Mostafa-36/fp-movie-recommender)  
A movie recommendation engine built entirely with FP techniques.  
Uses `pipe`, `filter`, `map`, and `reduce` to create a composable logic flow.

## 📌 Why This Repository?

The goal is to demonstrate how Functional Programming can be used to build clean, testable, and maintainable real-world applications.  
This serves as both a portfolio and a learning resource.
